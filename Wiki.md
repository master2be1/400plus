## About ##

`400plus` is a free firmware enhancement software which offers additional functionality and capabilities to your Canon 400D/XTi camera, in both a non-destructive, and non-permanent way. It works by loading into your camera's memory automatically upon boot-up to enhance the native camera firmware; but it is not a permanent firmware upgrade, and can easily be removed.

_It is designed specifically for the Canon 400D/XTi and will not work with other camera models._
