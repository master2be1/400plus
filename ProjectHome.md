_**about**_

`400plus` is a free firmware enhancement software which offers additional functionality and capabilities to your Canon 400D/XTi camera, in both a non-destructive, and non-permanent way. It works by loading into your camera's memory automatically upon boot-up to enhance the native camera firmware; but it is not a permanent firmware upgrade, and can easily be removed.

_This software is similar to what [Magic Lantern](http://magiclantern.wikia.com/wiki/Magic_Lantern_Firmware_Wiki) is for the DryOS cameras, though it is designed specifically for the Canon 400D/XTi and will not work with other camera models. For info about porting `400plus` to your camera, please visit [the Magic Lantern wiki](http://magiclantern.wikia.com/wiki/Other_dslr)._
